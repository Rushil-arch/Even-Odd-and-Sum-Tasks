# Even-Odd and Sum Tasks

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This Python script takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement. It displays the result accordingly.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
This Python script uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50, calculates the sum of all integers in this range, and displays the final sum.
